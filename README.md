# Deep-Volatility-Maximizing-Risk-Adjusted-Returns-with-Time-Series-Neural-Networks
Hybrid GARCH/BiLSTM forecasts multi-continent asset volatility (risk) to build a forward-looking Covariance Matrix. Weights are optimized via SLSQP to maximize Sharpe Ratio under diversification constraints. This notebook is not a financial advisor.
